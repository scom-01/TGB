You will need to change some of your project settings 
for some effects to be displayed in the game view as seen in the scene view.
To do this, follow these steps.

Edit > Project Settings... > Graphics > High(Tier3) > Uncheck "Use Defaults" Toggle > Toggle on "Use HDR"

The VFX should now look as intended in both the scene view and game view.
